# Digit-Recognition-with-NumPy

This a very basic Neural Network, made without any ML libraries to detect hand written digits. The data for the 60,000 hand written digits this NN can recognize comes from the MNIST dataset.

Note: This project requires [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to run, as Poetry was used to install any needed dependencies. 

This project was inspired by the video made by the [BotAcademy](https://www.youtube.com/c/BotAcademyYT/videos) youtube channel. An excellent resource to learn more about ML and neural networks.
